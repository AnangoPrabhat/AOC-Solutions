# AOC-Solutions
A collection of my solutions to AOC puzzles. 

# Information

- These solutions were written by me in an attempt to solve the problem as quickly as possible. Therefore, they are likely to be unreadable and messy.
- Most of the time, I edit my part one code into part two, so the part one code may be more complicated than the one I actually used to get the answer.
- The solutions are in python.
